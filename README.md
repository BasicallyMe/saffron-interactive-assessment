<h1>Thank you</h1>

<p>I am so grateful to Saffron Interactive for giving me this opportunity to work on the assessment question. It was a fun experience for me to create this interface, and I have gained a lot of knowledge and experience while creating it. It was a challenging task and I really enjoyed it</p>


<p>I have also made notes while working on this assessment, to explain my perspective of implementing the interface and to help you better understand my submission.</p>

<p>Here's the link to my notes âž¡ <a href="https://various-windshield-497.notion.site/Saffron-Interactive-Assessment-d70c9a41dc0a44ec96ad4f0644147b90">Saffron Interactive Assessment Notes</a></p>


<p>To view the output locally in your system, please ensure that you have node and npm installed in your system. I have used two packages as a dev-dependency for this project. Parcel-bundler to minify the output and react-icons for the back-button.</p>

<p>Once you clone the repository from github into a directory, move to this directory in your terminal and run the following commands first:</p>

<code>npm install --save-dev parcel</code>

<code>npm install --save-dev react-icons</code>

<p>Running these two commands will download all the necessary dev-dependencies for the output to render properly. Now to view the output please run the following command in the terminal of the directory</p>

<code>npm run dev</code>

<p>Now you can view the output in your browser at the address specified in the terminal output. The address will probably be localhost:1234</p>

<h2>Hope you have a great weekend</h2>
