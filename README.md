Thank you for giving me this opportunity to work on the assessment question. It was a fun experience for me to create this interface.


I have also made notes while working on this assessment, to explain my perspective of implementing the interface and to help you better understand my submission. Here's the link âž¡ https://various-windshield-497.notion.site/Saffron-Interactive-Assessment-d70c9a41dc0a44ec96ad4f0644147b90


To view the output locally in your system, please ensure that you have node and npm installed in your system. 

I have used two packages as a dev-dependency for this project. Parcel-bundler to minify the output and react-icons for the back-button.

Once you clone the repository from github into a directory, move to this directory in your terminal and run the following commands first

npm install --save-dev parcel

npm install --save-dev react-icons

Running these two commands will download all the necessary dev-dependencies for the output to render properly. Now to view the output please run the following command in the terminal of the directory

npm run dev

Now you can view the output in your browser at the address specified in the terminal output. The address will probably be localhost:1234
